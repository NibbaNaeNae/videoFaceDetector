# videoFaceDetector

## What does this script do?
+ This script does what it says... It detects faces on a video stream or web cam using haar cascade algorithm
+ I have the same script but it detects faces on images. [Link:] (https://github.com/NibbaNaeNae/basicImageFaceDetector) 

## Important details
